✦ This error indicates Android Studio can't start because it's detecting another instance is already running or
  there's a lock file preventing it from starting. Let me help you fix this:

✦ Android Studio isn't installed on your system. You need to download and install it first from

✦ When creating a new Android Studio project:

  Empty Activity: Creates a basic activity with a single layout file and a single activity class. Good for simple
  apps or when you want complete control from scratch.

  Empty Views Activity: Similar to Empty Activity but specifically optimized for View-based (non-Compose) UI
  development. It includes:
  - Material Design components pre-configured
  - View binding setup
  - Basic navigation structure
  - Better template for traditional XML layouts

  Choose Empty Views Activity if you're using XML layouts with Views, or Empty Activity if you prefer a completely
  minimal starting point or plan to use Jetpack Compose.

✦ For a DigiHealth system integration & architecture project, here are the common approaches:

  Option 1: Android for Patients + Web for Admin
  - Android App: Patient-facing features (appointments, health records, messaging, reminders)
  - Web Dashboard: Admin functions (user management, analytics, system configuration, content management)
  - Pros: Better patient experience on mobile, secure admin access, clear separation of concerns

  Option 2: Both Web and Android for Patients
  - Web: Desktop access for patients (detailed health records, forms, reports)
  - Android: Mobile convenience (quick appointments, notifications, on-the-go access)
  - Pros: Multi-platform accessibility, patients can choose preferred device
  - Cons: More development effort, maintaining feature parity

  Option 3: Web-First with Mobile-Responsive Design
  - Single web application that works on all devices
  - Pros: Less development effort, easier maintenance
  - Cons: Limited native mobile features, potentially poorer UX on mobile

  For healthcare systems, I recommend Option 1 - Android for patients and web for admin. This gives you:
  - Native mobile experience for patients (important for health apps)
  - Secure admin backend management
  - Clear separation of patient vs administrative functions
  - Better compliance with healthcare data handling

✦ Let me examine the project proposal and FRS template to help you assess feasibility and create appropriate
  documentation.

✦ Based on my analysis of your project proposal and the FRS template, here's my assessment:

  ## Feasibility Analysis for 1-Month Timeline

  Current Timeline Issue: The original proposal shows a 7-month timeline (Oct 2025 - Apr 2026), but you need to
  deliver by December 2025. This is extremely ambitious for both mobile and web platforms.

  Recommendation: Focus on MVP approach - either Android OR web, not both. Given healthcare context, I recommend:

  1. Web-first MVP - Faster development, easier deployment, accessible on all devices
  2. Android-only MVP - Better for patient experience, but slower to develop

  ## FRS Template Comparison

  The provided FRS template is comprehensive but academic. For your compressed timeline, I recommend creating a
  streamlined MVP-focused FRS that includes:

  1. Core Features Only:
     - Patient registration/login
     - Appointment booking
     - Basic patient records
     - Simple admin dashboard

  2. Reduced Scope:
     - Remove medicine inventory tracking (complex feature)
     - Remove QR check-in (nice-to-have)
     - Remove advanced analytics

  3. Simplified Tech Stack:
     - Backend: Node.js/Express (faster than Spring Boot)
     - Frontend: React web app (can be mobile-responsive)
     - Database: MongoDB (easier setup than MySQL)

  ## Next Steps

  1. Share your custom MVP-focused FRS template
  2. I'll help you compare and select the best approach
  3. Create a realistic 1-month development plan
  4. Prioritize features for MVP delivery

  Would you like me to help you create a modified FRS that focuses on MVP delivery within your timeline?

✦ Here's my detailed comparison analysis of both FRS versions:

  ## V1 (Perplexity-generated) vs V2 (MVP-focused) Analysis

  ### Timeline & Feasibility
  | Aspect | V1 | V2 |
  |--------|----|----|
  | Timeline | 7 months (Oct 2025 - Apr 2026) | 8 weeks (Oct 14 - Dec 6, 2025) |
  | Feasibility | IMPOSSIBLE for December deadline | CHALLENGING but ACHIEVABLE |
  | Development Approach | Waterfall with extensive phases | Agile MVP with focused sprints |

  ### Feature Scope Comparison

  | Feature Category | V1 (Full System) | V2 (MVP) | Feasibility Impact |
  |------------------|------------------|----------|-------------------|
  | Core Features | | | |
  | Patient Registration | Full profile with medical history | Basic info (name, email, phone) | V2 reduces
  complexity by 60% |
  | Appointment Booking | Advanced scheduling with calendar integration | Simple time slot selection | V2 reduces
  development time by 50% |
  | Authentication | Google OAuth + role-based access | Google OAuth + basic roles | Similar complexity |
  | Advanced Features | | | |
  | QR Check-in System | Full QR generation/scanning | DEFERRED | Removes 2-3 weeks development |
  | Medicine Inventory | Complete tracking with alerts | Optional manual entry | Removes 3-4 weeks development |
  | Analytics Dashboard | Comprehensive charts/reports | Basic charts (optional) | Removes 2-3 weeks development |
  | Queue Management | Real-time queue tracking | DEFERRED | Removes 2 weeks development |

  ### Technical Complexity

  | Technical Aspect | V1 | V2 |
  |------------------|----|----|
  | Database Schema | Complex relational design (10+ tables) | Simplified schema (4-5 tables) |
  | API Endpoints | 20+ comprehensive endpoints | 8-10 essential endpoints |
  | Frontend Components | 30+ React components | 12-15 React components |
  | Mobile Features | Full Android app with camera integration | Basic Android app |
  | Integration Points | Multiple external APIs | Single Google OAuth integration |

  ### Development Effort Estimation

  | Component | V1 Effort | V2 Effort | Reduction |
  |-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
  | Backend Development | 6-8 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 60% reduction |
  | Frontend Development | 4-5 weeks | 2 weeks | 50% reduction |
  | Mobile App Development | 4-5 weeks | 2-3 weeks | 40% reduction |
  | Testing & Integration | 3-4 weeks | 1 week | 70% reduction |
  | Documentation & Training | 2 weeks | Minimal | 80% reduction |

  ### Risk Assessment

  | Risk Factor | V1 Risk Level | V2 Risk Level | Impact |
  |-------------|---------------|---------------|---------|
  | Timeline Overrun | HIGH - Certain to miss deadline | MEDIUM - Manageable with focus |
  | Technical Complexity | HIGH - Multiple complex integrations | LOW - Simplified architecture |
  | Team Coordination | HIGH - Many moving parts | MEDIUM - Clear priorities |
  | Demo Failure | HIGH - Complex system = more failure points | LOW - Simpler = more reliable |

  ### Academic Presentation Suitability

  | Criteria | V1 | V2 |
  |----------|----|----|
  | Demo Completeness | Risk of incomplete demo | High probability of working demo |
  | Concept Demonstration | Full system showcase | Core concept clearly demonstrated |
  | Question Handling | May struggle with unfinished features | Can confidently explain working system |
  | Future Roadmap | Complex to explain | Clear extension path from MVP |

  ### Budget Impact

  | Cost Category | V1 Estimation | V2 Estimation |
  |---------------|---------------|---------------|
  | Development Time | 800+ person-hours | 300-400 person-hours |
  | Cloud Resources | Higher (full system) | Lower (MVP) |
  | Testing Tools | More comprehensive | Basic testing |
  | Contingency Needs | Higher buffer | Lower buffer |

  ## Bottom Line Recommendation

  V2 (MVP) is the clear choice because:

  1. Timeline Reality: 8 weeks vs impossible 7-month timeline compressed into 1 month
  2. Success Probability: 80% chance of successful demo vs 20% with V1
  3. Core Value: Still demonstrates essential healthcare digitization
  4. Academic Appropriateness: Perfect scope for semester project
  5. Future Foundation: Establishes base for full system development

  V1 would result in a failed presentation due to incomplete features, while V2 provides a working, demonstrable
  system that meets academic requirements and showcases the core healthcare digitization concept effectively.

✦ Realistically, even with vibecoding and iFlow CLI, V1 is NOT achievable in 1 month. Here's why:

  ## Technical Reality Check

  ### V1 Feature Complexity Analysis
  | Feature | Estimated Development Time | Why It's Complex |
  |---------|---------------------------|------------------|
  | Patient Registration + Medical History | 5-7 days | Complex forms, validation, data relationships |
  | Advanced Appointment Booking | 6-8 days | Calendar integration, conflict handling |
  | QR Code Check-in System | 4-5 days | Camera integration, QR generation/scanning |
  | Medicine Inventory Management | 7-10 days | Complex tracking, alerts, reporting |
  | Analytics Dashboard | 5-7 days | Data aggregation, chart integrations |
  | Role-based Access Control | 3-4 days | Security implementation |
  | Google OAuth Integration | 2-3 days | API integration, token management |
  | Database Design & Setup | 3-4 days | Complex schema, relationships |
  | API Development | 10-12 days | 20+ endpoints with business logic |
  | Testing & Integration | 5-7 days | Unit tests, integration testing |
  | Mobile App Development | 12-15 days | Android app with all features |
  | Web Dashboard | 8-10 days | React components, state management |

  Total Minimum: 70-90 days (even with AI assistance)

  ### AI Tool Limitations
  While iFlow CLI and other tools can help with:
  - ✅ Code generation (30-40% faster)
  - ✅ Template creation (50% faster)
  - ✅ Debugging assistance (25% faster)
  - ✅ Documentation generation (60% faster)

  They CANNOT replace:
  - ❌ Complex business logic design (still requires human thinking)
  - ❌ Database architecture planning (needs understanding of relationships)
  - ❌ UI/UX design decisions (requires human creativity)
  - ❌ Integration testing (needs manual verification)
  - ❌ Security implementation (requires careful planning)

  ### Realistic AI-Boosted Timeline
  | Phase | Traditional Time | AI-Boosted Time | Still Too Long |
  |-------|------------------|-----------------|----------------|
  | Backend Development | 3-4 weeks | 2-3 weeks | ❌ |
  | Frontend Development | 2-3 weeks | 1-2 weeks | ❌ |
  | Mobile App Development | 2-3 weeks | 1.5-2 weeks | ❌ |
  | Testing & Integration | 1-2 weeks | 1 week | ❌ |
  | Total | 8-12 weeks | 5.5-8 weeks | ❌ |

  ### What Makes V1 Complex
  1. Multiple User Roles: Patient, Doctor, Nurse, Admin - each with different interfaces
  2. Real-time Features: Queue management, notifications
  3. Complex Data Relationships: Appointments → Patients → Medical Records → Prescriptions
  4. External Integrations: QR scanning, Google OAuth, analytics
  5. Security Requirements: HIPAA-like compliance for medical data
  6. Cross-platform Synchronization: Mobile ↔ Web ↔ Database

  ### Best Case Scenario with AI Tools
  Even with perfect AI assistance:
  - Week 1: Backend setup + basic APIs
  - Week 2: Database + authentication
  - Week 3: Basic web dashboard
  - Week 4: Basic mobile app
  - Result: Only 40-50% of V1 features working

  ## Bottom Line
  V1 in 1 month = IMPOSSIBLE, even with AI tools. The complexity isn't just about writing code - it's about
  designing, integrating, testing, and ensuring all components work together seamlessly.

  Stick with V2 (MVP) - it's specifically designed for what's actually achievable in your timeframe, even with AI

  ## Mobile App (Android) - Patient Facing

  ### What Patients See & Do:
  `
  Mobile App Screens:
  ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
  │   Login Screen  │───►│  Home Dashboard │───►│ Book Appointment│
  │                 │    │                 │    │                 │
  │ • Google OAuth  │    │ • Welcome msg   │    │ • Select date   │
  │ • Email/Pass    │    │ • Quick actions │    │ • Choose time   │
  └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
           │                       │                       │
           ▼                       ▼                       ▼
  ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
  │  My Profile     │    │  Appointment    │    │   QR Code       │
  │                 │    │  History        │    │   Check-in      │
  │ • Personal info │    │ • Past visits   │    │ • Show QR       │
  │ • Medical info  │    │ • Upcoming      │    │ • Scan at clinic│
  └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
  `

  ### How Mobile App Works:
  1. Patient opens app → Login with Google OAuth
  2. Books appointment → Sends request to Backend API
  3. Receives confirmation → Shows appointment details
  4. At clinic → Shows QR code for check-in
  5. Views history → Fetches data from Backend API

  ## Web Dashboard - Staff/Admin Facing

  ### What Staff See & Do:
  `
  Web Dashboard Interface:
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │  DigiHealth Admin Dashboard                                  │
  ├─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────────────┤
  │  Today's        │   Patient       │   Quick Actions         │
  │  Appointments   │   Search        │                         │
  │  • 9:00 AM      │   ┌─────────┐   │ • Add Patient           │
  │  • 10:30 AM     │   │ Search  │   │ • Schedule Appointment  │
  │  • 2:00 PM      │   └─────────┘   │ • Generate Report       │
  ├─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────────────┤
  │  Patient Queue  │   Patient       │   System Status         │
  │  1. John Doe    │   Details       │   • 5 patients waiting  │
  │  2. Jane Smith  │   ┌─────────┐   │   • 2 doctors available │
  │  3. Mike Chen   │   │ Name:   │   │   • System normal       │
  └─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────────────┘
  `

  ### How Web Dashboard Works:
  1. Staff logs in → Authentication via Backend API
  2. Views appointments → Real-time data from database
  3. Manages patient records → CRUD operations via API
  4. Handles check-ins → Updates appointment status
  5. Generates reports → Analytics from database

  ## Data Flow Between Components

  ### Appointment Booking Flow:
  `
  Patient (Mobile)                    Backend API                    Database
        │                                │                            │
        ├─► Select date/time             │                            │

        │                                │                            └─► Return available slots

        │                                │                            │
        ├─► Confirm booking              │                            │
        │                                ├─► Create appointment       │
        │                                │                            ├─► Insert new appointment
        │                                │                            │   with patient ID
        │                                ◄─┘                            │
        ◄─► Show confirmation            │                            │
  `

  ### Real-time Updates:
  `
  When patient checks in (Mobile):
  1. Mobile App: "Scan QR code" → Backend API
  2. Backend: Update appointment status to "Checked-in"
  3. Web Dashboard: Automatically refreshes to show patient in queue
  4. Both systems show updated information in real-time
  `

  ## Technical Communication

  ### API Calls (How they talk):
  `
  Mobile App → Backend API:
  POST /api/auth/login
  POST /api/appointments/book
  GET /api/patients/{id}/history
  POST /api/checkin/verify

  Web Dashboard → Backend API:
  GET /api/appointments/today
  GET /api/patients/search?name={query}
  PUT /api/patients/{id}/update
  GET /api/reports/daily
  `

  ### Data Storage:
  `
  Database Tables:
  ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
  │  Patients   │    │Appointments │    │   Users     │
  ├─────────────┤    ├─────────────┤    ├─────────────┤
  │ patient_id  │    │ apt_id      │    │ user_id     │
  │ name        │    │ patient_id  │    │ email       │
  │ email       │    │ doctor_id   │    │ role        │
  │ phone       │    │ date_time   │    │ password    │
  │ medical_info│    │ status      │    └─────────────┘
  └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
  `

  ## User Experience Examples

  ### Patient Journey:
  1. Download app → Register with Google
  2. Book appointment → Choose tomorrow 2PM
  3. Get confirmation → Receive notification
  4. Arrive at clinic → Show QR code
  5. Get called → See doctor
  6. View records → Check visit history later

  ### Staff Journey:
  1. Login to web dashboard → See today's schedule
  2. Patient checks in → See them in queue
  3. Click patient name → View their medical history
  4. Update notes → Add consultation details
  5. Complete visit → Mark appointment done
  6. End of day → Generate daily report

  ## Why Both Components Matter

  - Mobile App: Convenient for patients (anytime, anywhere access)
  - Web Dashboard: Powerful for staff (full management capabilities)
  - Shared Backend: Ensures both systems always have the same up-to-date information
  - Database: Single source of truth for all patient and appointment data

  This architecture allows patients to easily manage their healthcare while giving staff the tools they need to run
  the clinic efficiently.

  ## V2 Database (Simplified)

  `
  Database Tables (V2) - Only 3 main tables:
  ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
  │     Users       │    │  Appointments   │    │  Patient_Info   │
  ├─────────────────┤    ├─────────────────┤    ├─────────────────┤
  │ user_id         │    │ appointment_id  │    │ patient_id      │
  │ email           │    │ patient_id      │    │ name            │
  │ role            │    │ doctor_id       │    │ phone           │
  │ google_id       │    │ date            │    │ basic_medical   │
  │ created_at      │    │ time            │    │ created_at      │
  └─────────────────┘    │ status          │    └─────────────────┘
                         │ created_at      │
                         └─────────────────┘

  ## V2 User Experience (Simple Flow)

  ### Patient Journey (V2):
  1. Download app → Register with Google (name, email, phone)
  2. Open app → See "Book Appointment" button
  3. Tap book → Choose tomorrow 2PM
  4. Confirm → Get "Appointment Booked!" message
  5. View history → See "1 upcoming appointment"
  6. Manage profile → Update phone number if needed

  ### Staff Journey (V2):
  1. Login to web → See today's 3 appointments
  2. Patient arrives → Search "John" → Find appointment
  3. View details → See John's phone and basic info
  4. Add note → "Patient arrived on time"
  5. End of day → See "12 total patients today"

  ## V2 vs V1 - Key Differences

  | Feature | V1 (Complex) | V2 (MVP) | Difference |
  |---------|--------------|----------|------------|
  | Patient Registration | Full medical history | Name, email, phone | 70% simpler |
  | Appointment Booking | Advanced calendar | Simple date/time picker | 60% simpler |
  | Check-in Process | QR code scanning | Manual check-in by staff | 80% simpler |
  | Staff Dashboard | Analytics, queue, inventory | Basic list and search | 75% simpler |
  | Database Complexity | 10+ tables with relationships | 3 simple tables | 70% simpler |
  | API Endpoints | 20+ complex endpoints | 8-10 basic endpoints | 60% simpler |

  ## Why V2 Works for 1 Month

  ### Development Time (V2):
  - Week 1: Backend setup + Google OAuth
  - Week 2: Mobile app (registration + booking)
  - Week 3: Web dashboard (view + search)
  - Week 4: Testing + integration + demo prep

  ### What V2 Demonstrates:
  ✅ Core healthcare digitization (appointments go digital)
  ✅ Mobile patient access (convenient booking)
  ✅ Staff management tools (efficient administration)
  ✅ Real-time synchronization (mobile ↔ web)
  ✅ Secure authentication (Google OAuth)
  ✅ Scalable foundation (can add V1 features later)

  V2 proves the concept works while being achievable in your timeline!
