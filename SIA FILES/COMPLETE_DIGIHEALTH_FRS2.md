## Compliance Roadmap
- Implement Google OAuth
  - Spring Security OAuth2 client + Google; map tokens to existing `User` entities and roles; add `/oauth2/authorization/google` and custom success handler.
- Add OpenAPI/Swagger
  - Include `springdoc-openapi-ui` in `pom.xml`; annotate controllers; expose `/swagger-ui/index.html`.
- Enforce admin role gating — ✅ IMPLEMENTED
  - `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/config/SecurityConfig.java:65–72` and `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/security/CustomUserDetailsService.java:32–37,53–58`.
- Add pagination
  - Use `Pageable` in repository methods; accept `page`/`size` in controllers; return `Page<T>` for lists (patients/doctors/appointments).
- Add audit logging
  - Create `AuditLog` entity (operation, actorId, resourceId, timestamp) and write audit entries in admin/doctor actions.
- Deliver minimal Android app
  - 5+ screens: Login, Appointments List, Appointment Detail, Create/Cancel, Profile; reuse backend endpoints; store JWT using `EncryptedSharedPreferences`; basic offline cache with Room or simple file cache.
- Standardize error schema
  - Implement a `@ControllerAdvice` with a unified error contract `{ code, message, details }`.

## Implementation Notes
- Postman flows available in `DigiHealth_Postman_Collection.json` for registration, login, admin approvals, appointments.
- Real component paths and backend endpoints are referenced for traceability.
