## FR-1: Patient Registration (Patient PWA)
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (PWA UI + API)

**Features:**
- Email/password registration API | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Patient endpoint `POST /api/auth/register-patient` | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Google OAuth 2.0 registration | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Capture medical profile (age, gender, allergies, conditions) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Registration confirmation email | NOT IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Approach:**
- PWA under `mobile/Patient-PWA/` posts to backend `POST /api/auth/register-patient`, then logs in via `POST /api/auth/login`, stores `accessToken`, and normalizes backend `User` into the PWA `Patient` shape for UI.

**References:**
- `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/controller/AuthController.java:33-37`
- `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/service/AuthService.java:43-57`
- `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/dto/RegisterDto.java:6-15, 58-64`
- PWA: `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientRegistration.tsx:93-143`

**Localization & Validation (PH):**
- PH-specific placeholders for name, email, phone, address, medications | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Phone inputs mask/format to `+63 9xx xxx xxxx`; accepts `09`, `9`, or `63` prefixes | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Client-side validation enforces `^9\d{9}$` after normalization | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Emergency contact fields use the same mask/validation | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Confirm Password field includes view/hide toggle | ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Code References:**
- Phone mask binding: `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientRegistration.tsx:310-317`
- Confirm Password toggle: `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientRegistration.tsx:349-363`
- Emergency phone mask binding: `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientRegistration.tsx:562-571`
- Normalization/format/validation helpers: `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientRegistration.tsx:593-618`
- Step validations using `isPHPhoneValid(...)`: `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientRegistration.tsx:73-76, 102-105`

## FR-2: Patient Login (Patient PWA)
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED (PWA UI + API)

**Features:**
- Email/password login API | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- JWT-based secure session | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Redirect to patient dashboard (PWA UI) | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Google OAuth 2.0 login | ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Implementation Approach:**
- Patient login is implemented in `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientLogin.tsx` using `fetch` to call `POST /api/auth/login`. On success, stores `accessToken` (JWT) and `user` in `localStorage`, then navigates to the dashboard.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Valid credentials return a JWT and current user payload.
- Doctors must be approved to log in; deactivated users are blocked.
- Token is attached to subsequent API calls via `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
- Google sign-in validates Google id_token and audience (client ID), checks intended role, and returns structured error payload `{ status, error, message }` on failure.
- Unregistered Google accounts return `400` with message `Account is not registered. Please sign up.`
- Duplicate registrations are blocked via normalized email uniqueness and DB constraint.

**References:**
- PWA: `mobile/Patient-PWA/src/components/PatientLogin.tsx:22-51`
- Controller: `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/controller/AuthController.java:32-44`
- Service (email/password): `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/service/AuthService.java:222-275`
- Service (Google login): `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/service/AuthService.java:56-87`
- Security: `backend/src/main/java/com/digihealth/backend/security/JwtAuthenticationFilter.java`

- Auto-prefix `Dr.` on Full Name when input is a normal name | ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- Phone input masks to `+63 9xx xxx xxxx` and normalizes `09`/`63`/`9` inputs | ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Code References:**
- Ensure `Dr.` prefix on blur: `web/src/components/RegisterLayout.js:41-45, 59`
- Phone mask helper and binding: `web/src/components/RegisterLayout.js:97-117, 152-160`

- Add pagination
  - Use `Pageable` in repository methods; accept `page`/`size` in controllers; return `Page<T>` for lists (patients/doctors/appointments).
- Add audit logging
  - Create `AuditLog` entity (operation, actorId, resourceId, timestamp) and write audit entries in admin/doctor actions.
- Deliver patient PWA app
  - Implement mobile-first UI under `web/`, enable install via manifest and service worker; later wrap with Trusted Web Activity for Play Store if needed.
- Standardize error schema
  - Implement a `@ControllerAdvice` with a unified error contract `{ code, message, details }`.

## Implementation Notes
- Postman flows available in `DigiHealth_Postman_Collection.json` for registration, login, admin approvals, appointments.
- Real component paths and backend endpoints are referenced for traceability.
