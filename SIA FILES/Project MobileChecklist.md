## 🔧 Recent Backend Stability Improvements (2025-12-10)
- WebSocket/SockJS handshake allowed for `/ws/**` to eliminate 401 errors.
- Frontend uses absolute backend URL for SockJS, preventing dev proxy aborts.
- These changes improve live updates reliability across web; Patient PWA continues using HTTP fetch for appointments.
